/*
This repository is dedicated to learning Python and its popular libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn. 
The Python folder contains various Python programming concepts, while other modules are saved in their respective folders.

## Goals

- Learn and practice Python programming concepts.
- Understand and utilize the NumPy library for numerical computations.
- Create visualizations using Matplotlib.
- Perform data manipulation and analysis with Pandas.
- Generate statistical visualizations with Seaborn.
- Practice Git commands and understand version control.

Additionally, I will be adding practice questions for each topic to reinforce learning. Important points and theoretical concepts are noted within the code to aid understanding before diving into the implementation.

Feel free to explore the folders and follow along with my learning journey!

Happy coding!
